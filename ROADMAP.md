# Roadmap

## Lecture Timeline (February 2026)
- 2026-02-04: Foundations of Agentic AI (module orientation, agent types, autonomy levels, reliability and governance)
- 2026-02-10: Foundations in Agentic AI - Interacting with Model API (OpenAI SDK basics, memory via chat history, tool calling, structured outputs, tracing)
- 2026-02-17: Prompt Engineering for Agents (CRAFT, shot-based prompting, instruction prompting, CoT/ToT/DoT, prompt chaining, parallel prompts, workflows with tools, ReAct)
  - Continuity: builds on 2026-02-04 agent foundations and 2026-02-10 API/tool-calling mechanics.

## Build Roadmap (Project Delivery)

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Agentic CLI + API
- plan -> act -> reflect loop
- basic tool calling
- JSON step logging

## Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): RAG Enterprise
- ingestion pipeline
- Postgres + pgvector
- citation-aware responses

## Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Evals Harness
- gold dataset and scoring metrics
- regression checks in CI

## Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16): Production Deploy
- Docker and IaC
- auth and rate limiting
- observability stack

## Capstone
- enterprise AI app in a known domain
