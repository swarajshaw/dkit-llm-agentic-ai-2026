# Progress Log

## Week 01
- [x] Repository initialized
- [x] Lecture notes captured
- [x] First lab completed

## Weekly Update (2026-02-04)
- What I learned: Core foundations of Agentic AI including agent types, autonomy levels, LLM basics, orchestration patterns, and reliability/security/governance risks.
- What I built: Added baseline foundations lecture notes for Week 1.
- Evidence (commits/PRs): Added `notes/01-agentic-foundations/2026-02-04-foundations-agentic-ai.md`.
- Next week focus: Move from concepts to implementation using model APIs, chat history, and tool calling.

## Weekly Update (2026-02-10)
- What I learned: How to interact with LMs via OpenAI-compatible API calls, manage chat history, use tool calling, and enforce structured outputs with Pydantic.
- What I built: Added lecture notes for Foundations in Agentic AI focused on model API interaction and observability.
- Evidence (commits/PRs): Updated `ROADMAP.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, and added `notes/01-agentic-foundations/2026-02-10-foundations-agentic-ai-model-api.md`.
- Next week focus: Implement a hands-on lab script for basic call + tool call + structured output + tracing.

## Weekly Update (2026-02-17)
- What I learned: Prompt engineering for agents, including CRAFT, zero/one/few-shot prompting, instruction prompting, CoT/ToT/DoT, prompt chaining, parallel prompts, workflows with tools, and ReAct loops.
- What I built: Added Week 3 lecture notes and expanded them with high-value concept examples plus Mermaid diagrams for prompt chaining, parallel prompts, and workflow with tools.
- Evidence (commits/PRs): Added and updated `notes/01-agentic-foundations/2026-02-17-foundations-agentic-ai-prompt-engineering-agents.md`, and updated `ROADMAP.md` and `PROGRESS.md`.
- Continuity with previous notes: Week 3 extends Week 1 foundations (`notes/01-agentic-foundations/2026-02-04-foundations-agentic-ai.md`) and Week 2 API/tool-calling mechanics (`notes/01-agentic-foundations/2026-02-10-foundations-agentic-ai-model-api.md`).
- Next week focus: Implement tutorial exercises in code (prompt-technique comparison on SLM/LLM and a multi-file ReAct workflow with tools).
